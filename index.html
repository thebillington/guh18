                    <p>Prepare your tastebuds for a feast. 90s steam is a website dedicated to ensuring you can re-live your childhood games, such as the version of Space Invaders below.</p>

                    <p>90s Steam was built for the <a href="http://greatunihack.com/" target="_blank">Great Uni Hack 2018</a> in Manchester for the challenge put forward by American Express.</p>
                    <p>The challenge was to take a modern day website and give it a retro, 90s twist. Naturally, with my inkling for games, I had to build a Steam client that the 90s would be proud of, and here it is.</p>

                    <p>I'm Billy Rebecchi, also known in the programming community as <a href="http://thebillington.co.uk" target="_blank">thebillington</a>.</p>
                    <p>I've been programming since the early 2000's, and in 2016 I achieved my undergrad BSc in Computer Science at Newcastle University, specialising in game engineering. Having finished my degree, I decided to go straight into teaching, completing my PGCE at Leeds Trinity University. I currently live and work in Birmingham as a full time secondary Computer Science teacher, and have recently started the second year of my Masters in Education.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I love building games, and try to attend Game Jams and Hackathons as much as possible to stay on top of my skills.</p>
                    <p>Check out my <a href="http://github.com/thebillington">github</a> for more information on my other projects.</p>
                    <div class="center"><h2>The Website</h2></div>
                    <p>In 2008 I started my Retro games console collection and have been an avid collector ever since, spending way too much time (and money) on retro consoles and games. To see just how far back my love of retro gaming goes, check out the registration date of this URL!</p>
                    <p>I built this website for Great Uni Hack 2018 to give an idea of what a website version of Steam may have looked like back in the 90s. I have also recreated some old games using vanilla JavaScript and p5.js, with themes from 2018.</p>
                    <p>Please feel free to check out the games and give me any feedback if there is something you like, or something you feel could be improved!</p>
